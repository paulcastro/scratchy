//! `scr bench startup --exec` — startup latency measured across a process
//! boundary, for any backend.
//!
//! The default (in-process) mode of `bench startup` times
//! `LLMBuilder::build()` inside this process. That cannot answer "how long from
//! launch until the user sees a word": it never execs, so it misses process
//! init, dynamic linking and first-touch page faults, and it never generates,
//! so it has no first token to stop a clock on.
//!
//! This mode holds the clock itself. It starts immediately before `fork`/`exec`
//! and stops on the first *content* byte of the first token — one span, not a
//! sum of two separately-measured ones. There is exactly ONE implementation of
//! that stopwatch and every backend goes through it, which is the fairness
//! guarantee: nothing is self-reported. The backend is named by
//! `--child-cmd "<command>"`, the same shell-words convention `scr sweep` uses
//! for `--serve-cmd`/`--bench-cmd`, so comparing against mlx-lm, vLLM or
//! anything else that speaks OpenAI-compatible HTTP needs no code here.
//!
//! THE CACHE LADDER, which is the whole point of the scenario flag:
//!
//! | surface                     | FROZEN   | COLD    | WARM              |
//! |-----------------------------|----------|---------|-------------------|
//! | OS page cache (weights/bin) | evicted  | warm    | warm              |
//! | derived on-disk caches      | removed  | present | present           |
//! | process                     | fresh    | fresh   | resident, ≥1 req  |
//!
//! A FROZEN rung has to prove its eviction actually happened or the run is
//! void, and the validity check at the end asserts that rather than leaving it
//! to a reader. Where the eviction can measure its own effect (a drop in
//! `/proc/meminfo` `Cached`) that is the evidence; `major_faults` is the
//! fallback for platforms without it, because readahead makes the fault count a
//! weak witness on Linux — a verified 500 MiB eviction was observed producing a
//! single major fault.
